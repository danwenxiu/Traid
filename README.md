# TriadFormer: Unifying State Space Modeling and Anatomical Transformers for Structured 3D Human Pose Estimation

Our code refers to the following repositories.
- [ DC-GCT](https://github.com/KHB1698/DC-GCT)
- [Mamba](https://github.com/state-spaces/mamba)
- [PoseSSM](https://github.com/yinhanxi/PoseSSM)
  
We recommend constructing the demo by referring to [GraphMLP](https://github.com/Vegetebird/GraphMLP), and you can achieve it by replacing the GraphMLP model.
We thank the authors for releasing their codes.
This is the official repository for our paper. The code will be released upon paper acceptance.
